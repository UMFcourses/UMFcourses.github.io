# Overview

Umeå Marine Sciences Centre (also called UMF) will offer from 2027 a one-week international advanced course on marine and aquatic photosynthesis, with a focus on examples from the Arctic, sub-Arctic and extreme environments. This advanced course will review algal and aquatic macrophyte photosynthesis basics, plus measurement and data analysis of photosynthetic flux, FRRF and PAM fluorometry. This advanced course is suitable for postgraduate students, postdoctoral scholars and career professionals seeking to strengthen their knowledge and skills in marine and aquatic photosynthesis research.

# Why come to Umeå Marine Sciences Centre?

Polar summer nights where it never gets dark, surrounded by wildflower meadows and pine forests - something few other marine stations can offer within easy reach of central Europe! And of course, you will get the opportunity to directly interact with our highly experienced instructors who between them have worked in marine environments from the equator to the poles! This exciting advanced course will include theoretical teaching and practical applications, using samples and data from phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, macroalgae and macrophytes.

## Course Dates and location  
The course will be held in-person (residential) at Umeå Marine Sciences Centre, Umeå University. Umeå Marine Sciences Centre is in the picturesque Swedish village of Norrbyn just 30 minutes south of Umeå. The course will run in the **summer of 2027** - check back soon for confirmation of dates.

## Course pre-requisites 
Pre-requisites for the course are:
1.	The language of the course is English. If English is not your first language, you will need to provide evidence that you have either completed an undergraduate degree in English or meet the Umeå University English proficiency requirements detailed here: [English requirements](https://www.umu.se/en/education/how-to-apply/entry-requirements/)
2.	Have undertaken, or are currently undertaking, a PhD degree in biology, chemistry, environmental science or equivalent
3.	Research focus on marine and/or aquatic photosynthesis. This could for example be evidenced by published papers or thesis, or a letter of support from your current supervisor / Principal Investigator.

## Detailed Course Content
Each day is divided into two sessions and includes both theoretical and practical aspects. Over 40 contact hours are provided during the week. 
-	Saturday/Sunday: Arrival. Welcome and team activities on Sunday afternoon (weather dependent, but might include a forest walk, BBQ, sauna or similar)
-	Monday (08:00 – 17:00): Introduction to the course, photosynthetic basics, sample collection
-	Tuesday (08:00 – 17:00): Bulk photosynthetic flux, PE curves, carbon-13 analysis
-	Wednesday (08:00 – 17:00): FRRF, PAM fluorometry, field excursion
-	Thursday (08:00 – 17:00): Multi-colour PAM fluorometry, photosynthesis-industry nexus
-	Friday (08:00 – 12:00): BYOD (Bring your own data), or plan your next photosynthesis study, plus the opportunity for supported data analysis / experimental design with course instructors. Review of skills learned during the course
-	Friday (12:00 to late): Departure
-	Saturday: Additional departure if needed for travel schedules

## Number of students 
15 student limit, ensuring a high instructor to student ratio 

## Primary instructors
The primary instructors on the course are Drs Heidi Burdett, Léon Serre-Fredj and Jenny Ask. Heidi is an Associate Professor of Coastal Ecosystem Science and Sustainability, investigating the extremes of photosynthetic capability in the oceans. Léon is a Staff Scientist in Numerical Ecology, focusing on explaining spatio-temporal phytoplankton dynamics. Jenny is an Environmental Analyst specialising in the role of microphytobenthos on boreal aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry.

## Course fee and details:
The course fee is estimated to be **8500 Swedish Kronor (SEK)** (ca. 760 Euro; for up-to-date exchange rate see here: [currency rate](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=8500&From=SEK&To=EUR))
