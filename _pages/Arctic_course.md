# Overview

Umeå Marine Sciences Centre (also called UMF) offers a one-week international advanced course on Arctic marine biology, ecology and biogeochemistry on Arctic coastal and oceanic realms. This advanced course will familiarise students with Arctic marine environments, their ecology and biogeochemistry and consider their fate in a changing world. This advanced course is suitable for postgraduate students, postdoctoral scholars and career professionals seeking to strengthen their overall Arctic marine knowledge.

# Why come to Umeå Marine Sciences Centre?

We offer the unique experience for a marine scientist to experience sea ice and the polar winter; something few other marine stations can offer within easy reach of central Europe! Further, [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/) is home of the European Polar Board (https://www.europeanpolarboard.org/), the leading organisation for coordinating European polar research, so you will be learning in an environment steeped in Arctic passion and the heart of Arctic marine research. And of course, you will get the opportunity to directly interact with our highly experienced instructors who between them have worked extensively in Arctic marine environments!

## Course Dates and location  
The course will be held in-person (residential) at Umeå Marine Sciences Centre, Umeå University, between the **15-20 February 2026**. Umeå Marine Sciences Centre is in the picturesque Swedish village of Norrbyn just 30 mins south of Umeå.

## Course pre-requisites 
Pre-requisites for the course are:
1.	The language of the course is English. If English is not your first language, you will need to provide evidence that you have either completed an undergraduate degree in English or meet the Umeå University English proficiency requirements detailed here: [English requirements](https://www.umu.se/en/education/how-to-apply/entry-requirements/).
2.	Have competed an undergraduate degree in biology, chemistry environmental science or equivalent.
3.	Academic experience of the marine environment. This could for example be evidenced by having undertaken an undergraduate level course on introductory marine ecology or similar. You will need to provide evidence of this.

## Detailed Course Content
Each day is divided into two sessions and includes lectures as well as workshops. Over 40 contact hours are provided during the week. The welcome and team activities on Sunday afternoon are weather dependent, but might include sea ice-associated activities such as cross country skiing, sauna or similar.
- Monday (08:00 – 17:00): Arctic Ocean and coastal structure, Arctic marine ecosystems, sea ice and circulation. 
- Tuesday (08:00 – 17:00): Arctic marine ecology, biology, biodiversity and food webs.
- Wednesday (08:00 – 17:00): Arctic carbon and nutrient cycling. Arctic marine photosynthesis and primary production.  Arctic blue carbon and the role of the Arctic seas in climate change mitigation.
- Thursday (08:00 – 17:00): Changing Arctic marine frontiers; warming, deoxygenation and exploitation.
- Friday (08:00 – 12:00):  Arctic marine governance and the future Arctic marine environment.
- Friday (12:00 to late): Departure
- Saturday: Additional departure if needed for travel schedules


## Number of students 
15 student limit, ensuring a high instructor to student ratio 

## Primary instructors
The primary instructors on the course are Dr Siv Huseby, Dr Jenny Ask, Dr Alexandra Rouillard and Prof. Nick Kamenos.  Siv is an Environmental Analyst with extensive expertise on Arctic marine phytoplankton dynamics, particularly during transitions between sea ice domination and the spring melt. Jenny is an Environmental Analyst specialising in the role of Arctic microphytobenthos on aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry. Alexandra is a Staff Scientist and has extensive experience conducting research in the Arctic with a focus on long term changes in Arctic marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure. Nick is a Professor of Marine Ecosystem Science and Director of Umeå Marine Sciences Centre. Nick has extensive expertise conducting research in the Arctic, in particular the impacts of glacial discharge on Arctic marine ecology and biogeochemistry.
